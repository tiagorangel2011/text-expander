Google Chrome Extension : Auto Text Expander
=========================
Keywords: chrome, extension, expander, auto, automator, replace, text, shortcut, autotext.

Another fun side project in my spare time. This simple chrome extension uses content scripts to insert javascript into any page you're using to attach a handler to your keydown event.

It basically keeps track of any consecutive keystrokes within 500ms or since the last space character you typed, and checks to see if the series of keystrokes matches any of a number of custom shortcuts you may have defined, and will then replace and expand the text in the field if it matches anything.

## Known Issues
 - I can't get this to work in Google Docs due to how Docs is architected. T_T
 - Similarly, Facebook comments is unavailable due to ReactJS's system.
 - Also, this doesn't work in Google Hangouts due to cross-origin policies.

## Technologies Used
 - jQuery
 - Moment.js
 - Chrome's Sync Storage (shortcuts are synced across browsers)

## Feature Requests
 - Localizing the extension
 - Domain whitelist/blacklist or on/off switch
 - Date Arithmetic
 - Add support for Google Docs comments
 - Add support for everhour.com
 - Opera extension version

## Updating Instructions
When releasing a new version, please update the following with the version number:
 - manifest.json [for json key "version"]
 - constants.js [for variable APP_VERSION]
 - background.js [function processingVersionUpgrade(), add previous version number]
 - README.md [version history section]

Hope this is useful to someone out there; would love any help optimizing and improving on it. Feel free to help contribute and expand on this project!
